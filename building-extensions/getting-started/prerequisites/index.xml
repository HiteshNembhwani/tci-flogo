      <description>Leveraging the already existing activities built by the Project Flogo community is really easy! Simply zip them up and upload them to TIBCO Cloud™Integration. Let&#39;s say that you want to use the Counter activity from the flogo-contrib repository on GitHub. We&#39;ll walk you through the steps to use that activity
First you&#39;ll need to download or clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib Now, create a zip file of the counter activity in the activity folder</description>

      <description>Creating new activities for the Flogo in TIBCO Cloud™Integration and/or TIBCO Flogo®Enterprise isn&#39;t hard. Depending on your requirements a new activity requires a bit of Go and possibly a bit of TypeScript. The TIBCO Cloud™Integration - Flogo®and TIBCO Flogo®Enterprise are powered by Project Flogo, so when you&#39;re developing extensions the runtime parts are the same as you would create them for Flogo. That also means that extensions for Flogo will work in TIBCO Cloud™Integration - Flogo®or in TIBCO Flogo®Enterprise and vice versa!</description>
