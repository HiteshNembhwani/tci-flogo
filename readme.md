# TIBCO Cloud Integration

[TIBCO Cloud Integration](https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-cloud-integration) is a way to seamlessly connect cloud-based services and on-premises applications, and easily model, create, test, and deploy custom APIs.

The [TCI](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/tci) repository is where we have an overview of the exciting extensions that are developed by the community! There are a bunch of ways you can help to make TIBCO Cloud Integration better:

* Submit feature requests on our [ideas](https://ideas.tibco.com/?project=TCI) portal
* Review the docs in this repo or on our docs [page](https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/docs/index.html) and let us know at `tci@tibco.com` what we've missed.
* Contribute new activities or projects for our Web Integrator or Business Studio.
