You're excited to extend Web Integrator with your own code? We are just as excited as you to help you develop your new extensions that will enable app developers to connect to other services.

Before you start, there are a few prerequisites that will make it a lot easier to create extensions:

* If you want to test the extensions you build, you'll need an account for TIBCO Cloud Integration. You can [sign up]((https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-cloud-integration)) for a 30 day free trial account!
* The Web Integrator in TIBCO Cloud Integration is powered by [Project Flogo](https://flogo.io), so it helps if you're familiar with it.
* You should know a few things about the concepts of **_Application_**, **_Flow_**, **_Activity_**, **_Trigger_**, **_Connection_** in the context of TIBCO Cloud Integation. Our [docs website](https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/docs/webintegrator/GUID-FE192F31-9F47-48A3-B921-B97F28A4D8D7.html) can help you there.

Now that we've got that covered, let's get coding!
