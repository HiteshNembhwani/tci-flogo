You're excited to extend Web Integrator with your own code? We are just as excited as you to help you develop your new extensions that will enable app developers to connect to other services.

Before you start, there are a few prerequisites that will make it a lot easier to create extensions:

* You should have an account for TIBCO Cloud Integration (TCI). If you don't have one you can [sign up](https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-cloud-integration) for free trial account.
* Get familiar with key concepts like **_Application_**, **_Flow_**, **_Activity_**, **_Trigger_**, **_Connection_**, which you can find in our [docs](https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/docs/webintegrator/GUID-FE192F31-9F47-48A3-B921-B97F28A4D8D7.html)
* Get up to speed with the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/) (1.7 and above) as Web Integrator runtime is powered by a Go based Open Source engine: [Project Flogo](http://www.flogo.io/).
* Get up to speed with [Angular TypeScript](https://angular.io/guide/typescript-configuration) and concepts like [NgModule](https://angular.io/guide/ngmodule), [Service](https://angular.io/guide/architecture#services), fat [Arrow Functions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/functions.html) and [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/overview.html) to create the nice looking UI pages for your extensions
* Read about [JSON](http://www.json.org/)

Right now you can create the following extensions:
* Activity - Add new activities to Web Integrator. An activity takes one or more inputs and construct one or more output values.
* Connector - Add new connection type to Web Integrator. A connector defines one or more configurations and makes connection with external services for example Marketo, Databases, etc.

Sounds exciting? Let's get [started](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/tci/wiki/Setting-up-your-dev-environment)!
