## Upload your contribution to TIBCO Cloud Integration
Once contribution is ready, you can upload it using your TIBCO Cloud Integration account.

Follow below steps to upload your contribution:
1. ZIP your `<category>` folder into `<category>.zip`. 
2. Login into your TIBCO Cloud Integration account and click on _**Extensions**_ section.
3. Upload zip file created in step #1. Uploaded artifacts would be stored in the backend storage. 

Refer [Web Integrator Apps](https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/docs/index.html) documentation for more details.

Once upload is successful, you should be able to use all uploaded contributions in the Web Integrator applications.
 
How to verify a successful upload?
* All connector contributions must be listed when new connection is being created.
* All activity contributions must be listed under the category when new activity is being added to the flow.

_Note: 
Upload is not incremental. When same category is uploaded again, any existing contributions for given category would be deleted from the backend storage._
