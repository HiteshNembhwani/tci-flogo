We are as excited as you to help you develop new cool contributions that will enable application developers do better integration with hundreds of services.

Before we start, you should

* Create an account on TIBCO Cloud Integration(TCI). Just sign up for free trial account.
* Read Flogo documentation. Get familiar with key concepts like Application, Flow, Activity, Trigger, Connection.
* Read about Go Programming Language (1.7 and above). The Flogo runtime is powered by Open Source Project Flogo.
* Read about Angular TypeScript concepts like NgModule, Service, fat Arrow Functions, ReactiveX
* Read about JSON
* Read Flogo Typescript SDK


You can add following contributions:

* `Activity` - Add new activity to Flogo. An activity takes one or more inputs and construct one or more output values.
* `Trigger` - Add new trigger to Flogo. An trigger can receive event and trigger flows
* `Connector` - Add new connection type to Flogo. A connector defines one or more configurations and makes connection with external services e.g. Salesforce, Database etc.
* `Function` -Add new function to Flogo.  A function define a specific function that does a specific job

Sounds exciting? Want to jump to coding?

We have 2 kinds of contributions.
1. Single contribution, which indicates the contribution just an independent contribution, such as: Single activity,  Single Trigger or a function
    * The contribution knows as Project Flogo or Open Source Contribution.
    * Please refer to [here](./oss)

2. Grouping contributions, which indicates there are several contribtions been developed as a single group/categorized contributions.
    * The contribution for TIBCO Cloud<sup>&trade;</sup> Integration Flogo<sup>&trade;</sup> or TIBCO Flogo<sup>&trade;</sup> Enterprise consist of several files that all have a very specific function.
