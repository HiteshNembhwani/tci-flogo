You're excited to extend Flogo with your own code? We are just as excited as you to help you develop your new extensions that will enable app developers to connect to other services.

Before you start you need to make a few choices, but don't worry we'll be here to help you!

## Build or Reuse?
Extensions for TIBCO Cloud<sup>&trade;</sup> Integration - Flogo<sup>&reg;</sup> follow the same model as [Project Flogo](https://flogo.io) does for the runtime parts and can be extended with TypeScript to enhance the user experience in the browser. For example, you might want to retrieve the business objects from Salesforce.com based on the connection details or show a series of checkboxes based on other configuration data. The choice you have to make is how you want to get started:

* [Reuse Project Flogo activities](./flogo): Because the Flogo in TIBCO<sup>&reg;</sup> Cloud Integration is powered by Project Flogo you can use activities you find on GitHub in Flogo as well!
* [Create new activities](./new-activities): You can also create brand new activities and you have a choice to enhance the user experience there with TypeScript or simply rely on Flogo to generate the user experience for you.
